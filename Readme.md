# Node.js Stryve-Backend

## Description

This backend system is designed to efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of text data, such as articles and books. The system supports the creation and management of unique identifiers (UUIDs) for text entries, detects duplicate content at the paragraph level, and compares stored content with text from specified crawled websites. It includes a scalable database for text storage, a web crawler for fetching content, and a RESTful API for interacting with the system. Key features include duplicate detection, content comparison, and secure data handling.
